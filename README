! Scope

Molecular Dynamics Simulation Analysis

These packaged python files will use a given atom id number and a distance value to analyze a part of a system using a lammps trajectory file.

It will analyze atoms with the given id and greater with a z position greater than the distance value.  


! Requirements

Python 3.6.2
Cython 0.26.1
Read/Write Permission


! phantom.pyx

This script creates atoms at 0,0,0 when there are a variable number of atoms in each timestep.
This allows VMD visualization of the file.

First, it finds every unique atom in the whole file.
Then, it cycles through the timesteps, placing the missing atoms at 0,0,0.


! read_dump.pyx

This script reads a lammps trajectory file and reduces it to only those atoms that fit the parameters specified by the user. 
Uses calculated scaled values for distance cut off.


! How To Run

Arguments:
	$ Variable :: Explanation
	<file name> :: name of the lammpstrj file to be analyzed
	<id of first atom> :: the atom with this id or greater will be analyzed
	<distance cut-off> :: atoms with a z value greater than this value will be analyzed  **negative numbers were not tested

$ Explanation :: Command Syntax

1. Compile phantom.pyx and read_dump.pyx to C files :: python setup.py
2. Run Script :: python run.py <file name> <id of first atom> <distance cut-off>

Output

This code will create two files: 
	$ Filename :: description
	"reduced_<file name>" :: Created by read_dump.pyx; The lammps trajectory file reduced to only those atoms within the parameters specified by the user.
	"padded_reduced_<file name>" :: Created by phantom.pyx; The "reduced_<file name>" file with the number of atoms per timesteps made constant.

	**Does not ouput ix, iy, iz


! Extensions

Create a variable for the id of the last atom
Assure use of negative numbers for the distance cut-off
